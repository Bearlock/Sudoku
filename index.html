		<h1>What exactly is Sudoku?</h1>
		<hr/>
  		<p>
  			According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Wikipedia</a> Sudoku is "a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle." The point of 			the game is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that make up the board contain all the numbers between 1 			and 9. To play, you essentially:
 		</p>
 		<ol>
 			<li>Put the numbers 1-9 into a grid</li>
 			<li>Make sure it is the only one of that number on that row</li>
 			<li>Make sure it is the only one of that number on that column</li>
 			<li>And make sure it is the only one of that number in the 9x9 square</li>
 		</ol>

  			Sudoku is thought to have designed by Howard Garns back in 1979. Sudoku did not become popular in the states until later, as one can most likely discern 			from the Japanese name. Sudoku gained its initial popularity after being introduced in Japan by game publisher Nikoli in 1984. The game took Japan by 				storm and was an immediate hit. A few decades later Sudoku would spread in popularity to various other countries and publications. The Times of London 				began featuring Sudoku in their publication in 2004. Even then, Sudoku appears to have roots to 19th century French number puzzles, based off of magic 				square puzzles.
